## Julia vs Python
I found articles about this topic. First one was against julia but it had somewhat poor evidence for julia downsides.
The last two articles i found favour julia over python for various situations by demonstrating benchmarks or code examples in comparison with python.

1. Against Julia - ['Giving up on Julia'](http://www.zverovich.net/2016/05/13/giving-up-on-julia.html) and ['Python Benchmarks'] (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Python_Meets_Julia_Micro_Performance)
2. Favour Julia - ['An Updated Analysis for the "Giving Up on Julia" Blog Post'](https://tk3369.wordpress.com/2018/02/04/an-updated-analysis-for-the-giving-up-on-julia-blog-post/)
3. Favour Julia - ['Python vs Julia Observations'](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/python-vs-julia-observations-e61ee667fa95)
